User Guide
==========

Workflow
--------

The connector imports the requirements from the needs file produced by the build process.
Refer to `needs_build_json`_ for details.

The connector exports the SCADE needs to a file (JSON) that can be imported with
the directive `needimport`_.

Configuration
-------------

The connector requires a minimal `build configuration`_ customization, to declare the types and extra options.

Example of sphinx-needs configuration (``conf.py``)::

    ...

    # sphinx-needs configuration
    needs_types = [
        # high level requirement
        {
            'directive': 'hlr',
            'title': 'REQ',
            'prefix': '',
        },
        # low level requirement
        {
            'directive': 'llr',
            'title': 'SC',
            'prefix': '',
        },
    ]

    # traceability link produced by the connector
    needs_extra_links = [
        {
            'option': 'covers',
            'incoming': 'is covered by',
            'outgoing': 'covers',
        },
    ]

    needs_extra_options = [
        # mandatory: icon of the element
        'icon',
        # when export graphics is selected: image of the element
        'image',
        # field 'Nature' of the DesignElement annotation
        'Nature',
    ]

    # define a custom layout to
    # * add the icon
    # * hide the id that
    # * insert the diagram or equation sets in the footer
    needs_layouts = {
        'scade-suite': {
            'grid': 'simple_footer',
            'layout': {
                'head': [
                    '<<meta("type_name")>>: <<image("{{icon}}")>> '
                    '**<<meta("title")>>**>> '
                    '<<collapse_button("meta", collapsed="icon:arrow-down-circle", visible="icon:arrow-right-circle")>>'
                ],
                'meta': [
                    '<<meta_all(exclude=["icon", "image", "layout"], no_links=True)>>',
                    'covers: <<meta_links("covers", incoming=False)>>'
                ],
                'footer': ['<<image("{{image}}")>>'],
            }
        }
    }

    # override the default regular expression for SCADE Suite OIDs
    needs_id_regex = r'^[A-Za-z0-9_!/]{5,}'

    # export the needs to a json file, to be imported by the connector
    needs_build_json = True

    ...

The ``scade-suite`` layout produces the following output:

Declaration
-----------

Use the command ``Project/ALM Gateway/Settings...`` once
to select the connector ``ALMGW Connector for sphinx-needs``.

Once the connector is selected, this command does not operate anymore.
Refer to the next section for details on settings management.

.. Note::

   If the project is already connected to an ALM tool, you have first to delete this connection
   by deleting the ALM Gateway project file (ALMGP) in the projectâ€™s directory.

Settings
--------

Using the Graphical User Interface
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This mode applies only to projects that can be loaded with SCADE Studio.
SCADE Display projects must be setup using the command line interface,
as explained in the next section.

Use the new command ``Project/ALM Gateway/sphinx-needs Settings...`` to:

* Select the requirements documents for each loaded project.
* Select the type names for needs and links.
* Specify an optional LLR export schema to produce the SCADE needs file.

  .. Note::

     Refer to `Traceable Elements Export Schema`_ for details.

* Specify the path of the SCADE needs file to export.

.. image:: /_static/settings.png

Using the Command Line Interface
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The command line tool python ``setup_ansys_scade_almgw_sphinx_needs.exe`` allows to setup
the project. It is located in the ``Scripts`` folder of the Python installation directory.

.. code:: text

   usage: setup_ansys_scade_almgw_sphinx_needs [-h] [-p <project>] [-u <upstream>]
                                               [-d <downstream>] [-l <link>] [-v <version>]
                                               [-s <schema>] [-o <output>] [-i [<inputs> ...]]
                                               [-g]

   options:
     -h, --help            show this help message and exit
     -p <project>, --project <project>
                           Ansys SCADE project (ETP)
     -u <upstream>, --upstream <upstream>
                           upstream type
     -d <downstream>, --downstream <downstream>
                           downstream type
     -l <link>, --link <link>
                           link type
     -v <version>, --version <version>
                           version of requirements
     -s <schema>, --schema <schema>
                           json export schema
     -o <output>, --output <output>
                           export document
     -i [<inputs> ...], --inputs [<inputs> ...]
                           requirements documents
     -g, --graphics        export diagrams

For example:

.. code:: text

   setup_ansys_scade_almgw_sphinx_needs -p MyProject.etp -u ../docs/_build/html/needs.json

Files
-----

Ansys SCADE ALM Gateway connector for sphinx-needs produces several files in the project's directory.

The ``<project.sphinx-needs.trace>`` file stores the traceability links
and must be added to the configuration management system.

The other files are present for logging or debug purpose only:

* ``<project.sphinx-needs.llrs>``: Temporary file for exporting the SCADE needs.
* ``<project.sphinx-needs.reqs>``: Copy of exchange file for importing the traceability.
* ``<links.json>``: Copy of exchange file for exporting the traceability.

Limitations
-----------

The connector does not export diagrams and equation sets.
