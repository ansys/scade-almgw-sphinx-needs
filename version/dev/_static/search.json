Using this approach, tox\ncommands similar to the following formats can be used:\ntox -e tests-py37: for running tests without coverage using the Python 3.7 interpreter delivered with SCADE.\ntox -e tests-coverage-py310: for running tests with coverage using the Python 3.10 interpreter delivered with SCADE.\nThe host python interpreter does not have to be the one delivered with SCADE when using this approach and this\nbehavior is agnostic of the host python version in which tox itself is installed. The important point to note\nis that Python 3.7 is compatible with SCADE releases prior to 23R2 and Python 3.10 compatibility starts with 23R2. This means\nthat py37 factor should be used when testing with releases prior to 23R2 and py310 factor should be used when testing\nwith releases starting from 23R2.\nUse tox\ntox\nMakefile\ntox\ntox\ntox\ntox -e code-style\ntox -e tests\ntox -e tests-coverage\ntox -e doc\ntox -e doc-html\ntox -e doc-links\nSCADE_INSTALLATION_DIR\nC:\\Program Files\\ANSYS Inc\\vXXX\\SCADE\npy310\npy37\ntox\ntox -e tests-py37\ntox -e tests-coverage-py310\npy37\npy310"
