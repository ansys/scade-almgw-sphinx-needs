Workflow
========

The connector imports the requirements from the needs file produced by the build process.
Refer to `needs_build_json`_ for details.

The connector exports the SCADE needs to a file (JSON) that can be imported with
the directive `needimport`_.

It provides the following built-in fields:

* ``id``: OID of the need
* ``title``: name of the need
* ``type``: downstream type specified in the settings

It also provides the following extra options that must be declared
in the `build configuration`_ (``conf.py``):

* ``image``: path of the image file otherwise ``<null>``
* ``scade_type``: kind of the need: ``EquationSet``, ``State``, ``Record``, etc.
* ``scade_path``: path of the need.
* ``scade_url``: URL to locate the need in the SCADE IDE.
* ``scade_icon``: icon associated to the need.

These options can be used in custom layouts or templates.

Configuration
=============

The connector requires a minimal `build configuration`_ customization, to declare the types and extra options.

Example of sphinx-needs configuration (``conf.py``)::

    ...

    # sphinx-needs configuration
    needs_types = [
        # high level requirement
        {
            'directive': 'hlr',
            'title': 'REQ',
            'prefix': '',
        },
        # low level requirement
        {
            'directive': 'llr',
            'title': 'SC',
            'prefix': '',
        },
    ]

    # traceability link produced by the connector
    needs_extra_links = [
        {
            'option': 'covers',
            'incoming': 'is covered by',
            'outgoing': 'covers',
        },
    ]

    needs_extra_options = [
        # mandatory connector options
        'scade_path',
        'scade_type',
        'scade_url',
        'scade_icon',
        # when export graphics is selected: image of the element
        'image',
        # field 'Nature' of the DesignElement annotation
        'Nature',
    ]

    # define a custom layout to
    # * add the icon
    # * hide the id
    needs_layouts = {
        'scade-suite': {
            'grid': 'simple',
            'layout': {
                'head': [
                    '<<meta("type_name")>>: <<image("{{scade_icon}}")>> '
                    '**<<meta("title")>>**>> '
                    '<<collapse_button("meta", collapsed="icon:arrow-down-circle", visible="icon:arrow-right-circle", initial=True)>>'
                ],
                'meta': [
                    '<<meta_all(exclude=["scade_icon", "image", "layout"], no_links=True)>>',
                    'covers: <<meta_links("covers", incoming=False)>>',
                ],
            },
        }
    }

    # override the default regular expression for SCADE Suite OIDs
    needs_id_regex = r'^[A-Za-z0-9_!/]{5,}'

    # export the needs to a json file, to be imported by the connector
    needs_build_json = True

    # reduce the size of the file
    needs_json_remove_defaults = True

    ...

Example of template (``llr.need``):

.. code-block:: jinja

   **{{scade_type}}**: `{{scade_path}} <{{scade_url}}>`_

   **Nature**: {{Nature}}

   {% if image != "<null>" %}
   .. image:: {{image}}
   :alt: {{title}}
   {%- endif %}

   Covers:
   {% for link in covers %}
   {# :need:`{{link}} <{{link}}>`: :ndf:`copy('title', '{{link}}')` #}
   | **{{link}}**: :ndf:`copy('title', '{{link}}')`
   {%- endfor %}


You can import the SCADE needs using the custom ``scade-suite`` layout
and ``llr`` template to render needs as follows:

.. code-block:: rst

   .. needimport:: /_scade/model.json
       :layout: scade-suite
       :template: llr

.. image:: /_static/llr.png

Declaration
===========

Use the command ``Project/ALM Gateway/Settings...`` once
to select the connector ``ALMGW Connector for sphinx-needs``.

Once the connector is selected, this command does not operate anymore.
Refer to the next section for details on settings management.

.. Note::

   If the project is already connected to an ALM tool, you have first to delete this connection
   by deleting the ALM Gateway project file (ALMGP) in the projectâ€™s directory.

Settings
========

Using the Graphical User Interface
----------------------------------

This mode applies only to projects that can be loaded with SCADE Studio.
SCADE Display projects must be setup using the command-line interface,
as explained in the next section.

Use the new command ``Project/ALM Gateway/sphinx-needs Settings...`` to:

* Select the requirements documents for each loaded project.
* Select the type names for needs and links.
* Specify an optional LLR export schema to produce the SCADE needs file.

  .. Note::

     Refer to `Traceable Elements Export Schema`_ for details.

* Specify the path of the SCADE needs file to export.

.. image:: /_static/settings.png

Using the Command-Line Interface
--------------------------------

The Python command-line tool ``setup_ansys_scade_almgw_sphinx_needs.exe`` allows to setup
the project. It is located in the ``Scripts`` folder of the Python installation directory.

.. code:: text

   usage: setup_ansys_scade_almgw_sphinx_needs [-h] [-p <project>] [-u <upstream>]
                                               [-d <downstream>] [-l <link>] [-v <version>]
                                               [-s <schema>] [-o <output>] [-i [<inputs> ...]]
                                               [-g]

   options:
     -h, --help            show this help message and exit
     -p <project>, --project <project>
                           Ansys SCADE project (ETP)
     -u <upstream>, --upstream <upstream>
                           upstream type
     -d <downstream>, --downstream <downstream>
                           downstream type
     -l <link>, --link <link>
                           link type
     -v <version>, --version <version>
                           version of requirements
     -s <schema>, --schema <schema>
                           json export schema
     -o <output>, --output <output>
                           export document
     -i [<inputs> ...], --inputs [<inputs> ...]
                           requirements documents
     -g, --graphics        export diagrams

For example:

.. code:: text

   setup_ansys_scade_almgw_sphinx_needs -p MyProject.etp -u ../docs/_build/html/needs.json

Files
=====

Ansys SCADE ALM Gateway connector for sphinx-needs produces several files in the project's directory.

The ``<project.sphinx-needs.trace>`` file stores the traceability links
and must be added to the configuration management system.

The other files are present for logging or debug purpose only:

* ``<project.sphinx-needs.llrs>``: Temporary file for exporting the SCADE needs.
* ``<project.sphinx-needs.reqs>``: Copy of exchange file for importing the traceability.
* ``<links.json>``: Copy of exchange file for exporting the traceability.

Limitations
===========

The connector does not export diagrams and equation sets.
